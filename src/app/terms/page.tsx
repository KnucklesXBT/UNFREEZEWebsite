      <h2>6. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App may provide AI-generated task suggestions and breakdowns. These outputs are provided for informational
        purposes only and may be incomplete, incorrect, or inappropriate for your situation. You remain solely
        responsible for your decisions and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is not a substitute for professional advice (including medical, legal, financial, or mental-health
        advice). Do not rely on the App for emergencies or high-stakes decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The App, including its design, branding, and software, is owned by the Developer and/or licensors and is
        protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not use our trademarks or branding without
        permission.

      </p>

      <h2>8. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms, misuse the App, or if necessary to protect the
        App, other users, or comply with law. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including IP,
        disclaimers, limitation of liability, and governing law) will survive.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind to the maximum extent permitted
        by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty exclusions; in that case, the above exclusions may
        not apply to you.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages arising from your use of the App. Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such
        limitation is not permitted by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law; Consumer Rights</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
        If you reside in a jurisdiction that provides mandatory consumer protections, those protections apply to you
        notwithstanding this governing law clause.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we may provide notice in the App or
        by other reasonable means. Continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.
